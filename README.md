# Boba Best Teas Database Project

Welcome to my CS 340 Database class portfolio project for Oregon State University. In this project, I've designed and implemented a SQL database for a fictional boba shop called Boba Best Teas.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a robust and efficient database system to manage various aspects of Boba Best Teas, including customer orders, inventory, and employee information.

## HTML Files

This repository includes several HTML files representing the user interface for interacting with the database:

- `customer.html`: User interface for managing customer information.
- `drink.html`: User interface for managing drinks on the menu.
- `order.html`: User interface for placing and managing customer orders.
- `topping.html`: User interface for managing toppings on drinks.
- `update_customer.html`: User interface for updating customer information.
- `update_drink.html`: User interface for updating drink information.
- `update_topping.html`: User interface for updating topping information.
- `index.html`: Main page or landing page for the Boba Best Teas application.

## How to Use

1. **Database Setup:**
   - Import the SQL script (`boba_best_teas.sql`) provided to set up the initial database schema and populate it with sample data.

2. **Exploring the Database:**
   - Use SQL queries to retrieve information about customer orders, inventory levels, and employee details.

3. **Using the User Interface:**
   - Open the HTML files in a web browser to interact with the user interface for managing different aspects of the boba shop.

## Project Files

- `boba_best_teas.sql`: The SQL script containing the database schema and sample data.
- `queries.sql`: A set of SQL queries demonstrating various operations on the database.

## Technologies Used

- SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Database Management System (DBMS) of your choice (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- HTML for the user interface
